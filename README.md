BankAccount class in src -> main/java is the class which I have used for experimenting with different test methods.

All different types of test classes(methods) are in the src -> test -> java folder with their description on the filename.

src -> test -> resources -> details.csv file is used as a input for Parameterized test in the Testingwith-JUnit/src/test/java/BankAccountParameterizedTest.java.
